## Paper Overview

In this paper we estimate the effect of Sugar-Sweetened Beverage (SSB) taxes in the United States on sugar consumption. In particular, we use data from the Nielsen Consumer Panel merged with nutrition data to observe quantities of micronutrients purchased by households during a mutli-year span when several localities passed SSB taxes:
1. Feb. 2015: Berkeley, CA - 1 cent per ounce
2. Jan. 2017: Philadelphia, PA - 1.5 cents per ounce
3. Apr. 2017: Albany, CA - 1 cent per ounce
4. Jul. 2017: Boulder, CO - 2 cents per ounce
5. Jul. 2017: Oakland, CA - 1 cent per ounce
6. Aug. 2017 - Dec. 2017: Cook County, IL - 1 cent per ounce
7. Jan. 2018: San Francisco, CA: 1 cent per ounce
8. Jan. 2018: Seattle, WA: 1.75 cents per ounce

## Preview of findings

* Taxes significantly decrease sugar purchased in taxed localities
* However, households often shop outside taxed localities, and levying the taxes significantly increases cross-border shopping
* Net sugar purchases at the household level decline modestly relative to the counterfactual
